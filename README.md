# routerantennaposition
Java code using Genetic Algorithm for Optimized placement of Routers and Antennas in a defined environment.
The Genetic Algorithm searches for the minimum quantity of cable to be used between 4 routers and 32 antennas spots (8 for each router) out of 33 available. This is computed by using a Manhattan Distance measure, and used as fitness. If a required spot is not used a penalty is added to the fitness value to reduce importance of such solutions in the population. Reproduction method used is cloning with a 10% probability of individual gene mutation, yielding a >97% probability of change during cloning.
